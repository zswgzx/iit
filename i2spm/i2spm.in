# i2spm.in
#
# This file contains information vital for the i2spm program,
# which converts GE I.* files and epirecon I.* files to SPM-
# compatible Analyze format.
#
# Note: Data files are written in the native byte order for SPM
# compatibility. The Analyze file format contains no byte order
# info in the header, and SPM expects native byte order when it
# opens files.

# Image slice file header size
HDRSIZE 0

# Slice files; include path if necessary (usually not). Typically,
#   I.%03i.s%02i  for EPI  (TIMEPTS must be > 1 for 2 %i specifiers;
#                           the first is time, the second slice)
#   I.%03i        for anat (TIMEPTS must be 1 for 1 %i specifier,
#                           which is slice number)
# Examples:
# INFILEMASK /atlas2/rogers/spm/jdesousa/S7/I.%03i.s%02i
# INFILEMASK I.%03i.s%02i
INFILEMASK meanDW%03i.img

# Output file(s); as above. Typically,
#   S5-motor.%03i  for EPI
#   S2-spgr       for anat
# The extensions .img and .hdr are always automatically added.
OUTFILEMASK meanDW_spm

# Number of slices (also change the appropriate one of PIXEL_X,
# PIXEL_Y, or PIXEL_Z if you change this!)
SLICES 141

# Total number of time points, including the ones you'll ignore
TIMEPTS 1

# Ignore this many time points at the beginning; 0 to use them all
TIGNORE 0

# Slice axis (COR, AXI, SAG)
AXIS AXI

# Number of pixels in each direction:
#  X is right to left
#  Y is anterior to posterior
#  Z is inferior to superior 
# One of these should be the same as SLICES.
PIXEL_X 256
PIXEL_Y 256
PIXEL_Z 141

# Orientation and origin info; extent is from voxel edge
# to voxel edge in the slice plane (i.e., FOV), and from
# center to center along the slice axis.
# Numbers are mm.
#
# The conversion to spm format uses this info to find
# the voxel size and the data file byte sequence; the
# conversion to afni format uses it to determine the origin.
#
# Order matters! For example, putting 120R-120L when it
# should be 120L-120R flips the image left-right. Use R-L,
# A-P, and S-I for the two axes you don't know from the
# scan info sheet.
#
# X is the sagittal axis, Y the coronal, and Z the axial.
XRANGE 120L-120R
YRANGE 120P-120A
ZRANGE 61.25I-70.0S

# SPM file scale factor. Generally, use 1.
SCALE 1

# Set OVERWRITE to YES to overwrite existing output files
# if you're running i2spm a second time. Set to NO to avoid
# overwriting. Do not comment this line out, though.
OVERWRITE YES

# Data type (only SHORT).
